-started with fpv drone. researched abt analog fpv. looked at digital too but parts expensive so dropped it. decided to make 6s analog drone for better power and efficiency.  
-decided on using geprc mark 4 5" frame (carbon). looked strong and good layout.  
-picking speedy bee f405 v4 stack. includes fc + esc, supports 6s. liked the layout and price.  
-using ECO II 2207 1700kv motors. 4 of them.  
-picked happymodel ep1 for receiver (elrs).  
-props are 3 blade 5". generic.  
-started spreadsheet for all parts and links <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c30N8WBJNnLRUuRY_XUVv_2eKSSWEUxoR_eZoAOhje8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

-finished with cad. cad of drone was pretty easy. now im starting with goggles. i started making goggles. it was hard so this is what my first attempt looked like-
-i didnt fully finish it because i decided to change the screen size. im using 2 lenses of 45mm diameter. the focal length or whatever is about 75mm. for the receiver im using rx5808 with a 5" car monitor that im gonna be tearing down.
